# Offline Book Search
An offline application for searching an index of open-access books.

During my student days, a great deal of benefit was gained, and, in fact, still is, by wandering through a library’s books. Such wandering enabled me to go beyond a course’s formal requirements. For example, understanding multi-dimensional spaces was difficult for me. Then I ran across a book by a Russian mathematician that had been translated into English. His explanation and illustrations were so clear that I was able to grasp and apply the concept. This was important not only in mathematics but also in designing computer systems, especially the structure of data in memory.

Jeff Edmunds, Digital Access Coordinator at Penn State University Libraries, gives an excellent discussion on why open-access text books are so important (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PygUK16aQgk). Traditional means of publishing and purchasing text books have become too expensive for increasing numbers of students. This creates a barrier to learning and economic growth, and not just in developing nations.

BookSearch, the capability presented here, allows one to explore the “card catalog” of a large collection of open-access downloadable books. The search can be conducted without internet access. However, internet access is required to actually download a book. The idea is to make best use of internet access when that is available. This supports people who do not always have internet access, an important consideration in many parts of the world. If internet access is readily available, an online version of this application is available: https://informationanthology.net/Open-Access-Search.html. The offline-search capability can be downloaded from https//informationanthology.net/OfflineBookSearch.zip (87.3kb).
